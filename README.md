# JobCloudFront

Demo frontend app for a small weekend project called [Job Cloud](https://github.com/mgoodnight/job-cloud).

See [backend app](https://github.com/mgoodnight/job-cloud-flask) if you're curious on how the generated images are served. 

## Development server

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running linting
